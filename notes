Why I picked this company (Broadcom / AVGO)

I selected Broadcom (AVGO) because it combines a highly profitable semiconductor business with a growing infrastructure software segment,
creating a strong mix of recurring cash flows and pricing power.
Broadcom operates in attractive markets such as data centers, networking,
cloud infrastructure, and enterprise software, which benefit from long-term demand drivers like AI, hyperscale cloud expansion, and increasing connectivity.

Broadcom is especially interesting due to its consistently high free cash flow generation,
strong operating margins, and its history of disciplined capital allocation through acquisitions and shareholder returns.
The key objective of this analysis is to determine whether Broadcom’s cash flow strength is sustainable over the long term,
how dependent it is on cyclical semiconductor demand,
and whether the current valuation reflects an appropriate margin of safety given its growth opportunities and leverage from acquisitions (e.g., VMware integration).

The main questions for deeper research are: how resilient Broadcom’s semiconductor segment is in a downturn,
how stable the software segment will become over time, and whether Broadcom can maintain its high margins and return on invested capital while continuing to scale.
